# Quick Tour

## Internationalization

If you frequently use another currency, you can set your [Base Currency](basic/base-currency.md).

If you prefer to use `,` instead of `.` as decimal separator, you can set your [Decimal Separator](basic/decimal-separator.md).

If you use another language, you can switch your language preference.

## Accuracy of Conversions

For results containing decimals, Currency Converter retains four significant digits.

Currency Converter uses a free API provided by [exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to obtain exchange rate information, which is updated daily.

For conversions involving the following currencies, Currency Converter uses **Direct Rate**.

For conversions not involving the following currencies, Currency Converter uses **Cross Rate** with USD as an intermediary.

* USD (US Dollar)
* CNY (Chinese Yuan)
* EUR (Euro)
* JPY (Japanese Yen)
* GBP (British Pound)
* AUD (Australian Dollar)
